      <p class="card-text">What if damnation is the price of true love?

		Innocent blood has been spilled on the steps of the Council Hall, the sacred stronghold of the Shadowhunters. 
		In the wake of the tragic death of Livia Blackthorn, the Clave teeters on the brink of civil war. One fragment 
		of the Blackthorn family flees to Los Angeles, seeking to discover the source of the blight that is destroying the race of warlocks. Meanwhile, Julian and Emma take desperate measures to put their forbidden love aside and undertake a perilous mission to Faerie to retrieve the Black Volume of the Dead. What they find in the Courts is a secret that may tear the Shadow World asunder and open a dark path into a future they could never have imagined. Caught in a race against time, Emma and Julian must save the world of Shadowhunters before the deadly power of the parabatai 
		curse destroys them and everyone they love.</p>

		Emma Carstairs has finally avenged her parents. She thought she'd be at peace. But she is anything but calm.
		Torn between her desire for her parabatai Julian and her desire to protect him from the brutal consequences 
		of parabatai relationships, she has begun dating his brother, Mark. But Mark has spent the past five years trapped in Faerie; 
		can he ever truly be a Shadowhunter again?

		And the faerie courts are not silent. The Unseelie King is tired of the Cold Peace, 
		and will no longer concede to the Shadowhunters' demands. Caught between the demands of faerie and the laws of 
		the Clave, Emma, Julian, 
		and Mark must find a way to come together to defend everything they hold dear—before it's too late.</p>

	It's been five years since the events of City of Heavenly Fire that brought 
	the Shadowhunters to the brink of oblivion. Emma Carstairs is no longer a child 
	in mourning, but a young woman bent on discovering
	what killed her parents and avenging her losses.

	Together with her parabatai Julian Blackthorn, Emma must learn to trust her head and her heart as she investigates a demonic plot that stretches across LA, from the Sunset Strip to the enchanted sea that pounds the beaches of Santa Monica. If only her heart didn't lead her in treacherous directions...</p>
